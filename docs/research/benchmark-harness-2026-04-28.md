# CEO benchmark harness notes

Date: 2026-04-28
Status: benchmark harness added before first real local-model comparison

## What was added

A reusable benchmark harness now exists under `backend/benchmarks/`.

Files:
- `backend/benchmarks/run_llm_bench.py`
- `backend/benchmarks/cases.py`
- `backend/benchmarks/targets.research-shortlist.example.json`
- `backend/benchmarks/README.md`

Related backend changes:
- `backend/services/llm_service.py` now supports provider overrides for benchmark runs
- `backend/services/gemini_service.py` accepts an optional model override
- `backend/services/ollama_service.py` accepts model/base-url overrides and safer error handling
- `backend/config.py` resolves `backend/.env` more reliably for benchmark execution
- `README.md` now includes benchmark usage instructions

## Harness goals

This harness is not meant to be a complete automatic judge of model quality.
Its purpose is to give CEO a repeatable screening tool for local and hosted model candidates.

What it captures:
- per-case latency
- response size
- heuristic score based on required content or JSON validity
- raw model outputs for later manual review

## Current case set

The first case set is CEO-specific rather than benchmark-generic.

It covers:
- architecture understanding
- git safety behavior
- code review / bug spotting
- implementation planning
- structured JSON output
- local model selection reasoning

## Design decisions

1. The harness uses fixed benchmark cases instead of free-form prompts.
2. Results are written to `output/benchmarks/` as both JSON and Markdown.
3. A `mock` provider exists so the harness can be validated without depending on a real model runtime.
4. Provider creation is lazy, so listing cases or running `mock` does not require Gemini packages to be installed.
5. The case suite reads repo files directly so the prompts stay grounded in the actual codebase.

## Validation completed

Validation run on 2026-04-28:
- `python3 -m py_compile backend/config.py backend/services/*.py backend/benchmarks/*.py`
- `cd backend && python3 -m benchmarks.run_llm_bench --list-cases`
- `cd backend && python3 -m benchmarks.run_llm_bench --provider mock --limit 3 --output-dir /tmp/ceo-bench-test`

Observed result:
- the harness listed all expected cases
- the mock provider completed a benchmark run and produced JSON + Markdown outputs

## Important limitation before real benchmarking

At the time this note was written, the local machine only had this Ollama model installed:
- `qwen2.5-coder:14b`

The planned first comparison targets are still:
- `qwen3:8b`
- `gemma3:12b`
- `phi4:14b`

Those need to be pulled locally before the first real benchmark pass.

## Next step

1. Pull the first three Ollama benchmark targets.
2. Run the harness across all three.
3. Save the benchmark outputs and an analysis note in the repo.
4. Pick the strongest first default candidate for CEO local testing.
